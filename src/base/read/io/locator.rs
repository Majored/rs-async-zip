//!
//! As with other ZIP libraries, we face the predicament that the end of central directory record may contain a
//! variable-length file comment. As a result, we cannot just make the assumption that the start of this record is
//! 18 bytes (the length of the EOCDR) offset from the end of the data - we must locate it ourselves.
//!
//! The `zip-rs` crate handles this by reading in reverse from the end of the data. This involves seeking backwards
//! by a single byte each iteration and reading 4 bytes into a u32. Whether this is performant/acceptable within a
//! a non-async context, I'm unsure, but it isn't desirable within an async context. Especially since we cannot just
//! place a [`BufReader`] infront of the upstream reader (as its internal buffer is invalidated on each seek).
//!
//! Reading in reverse is still desirable as the use of file comments is limited and they're unlikely to be large.
//!
//! The below method is one that compromises on these two contention points. Please submit an issue or PR if you know
//! of a better algorithm for this (and have tested/verified its performance).
